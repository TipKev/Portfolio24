      Hello! My name is Kevin Lin. I am a 29 year old living in New York City. I am a software engineer student by day and a cryptocurrency trader by night. 
    </p>
    

			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>
        I've been a project manager/scrum master for the past 4 years. 
				Earlier this year, I decided to start a new career in software engineering.
				I like being able to create and develop web applications more than I like managing projects. 
				So I joined Thinkful to learn how to write code.  
				Hopefully after 6 months of writing code intensely,
				I can take the next steps to slowly transition into an engineering role.
				Fingers crossed!
			</p>

      <p>
        Some of my interests outside of coding are basketball, snowboarding, and traveling.
